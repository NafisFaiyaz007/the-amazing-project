# What is the Amazing APP?
“The Amazing App”, a web-based application which is used for encrypting and decrypting confidential files online is a implementation targeting to overcome the crisis. The app is designed in such a way so that a user is able to user their google account to sign up and use facial recognition system as a 2nd factor authentication to log into the app. After a successful login, the user can import files from their google drive, encrypt or decrypt them as when necessary.

The initial goal of the “The Amazing App” web-app is to create a platform where the user can encrypt and decrypt a file using the app. The decrypted file can be viewed within the app using a file viewer, and the encrypted file can be stored to the users google drive. The user can also import files from their local disk use the app features.

The app provides a 2-Factor authentication where the first step is Google Oauth2.0 authentication and the second step is an image authentication. In google Oauth authentication, the user needs to sign up using their google account and after successful sign up, the user is redirected for image authentication. For image authentication and recognition, the app uses FACE IO API which is a robust service for face authentication service.
